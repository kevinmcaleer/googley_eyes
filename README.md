## Idea

The camera will run opencv and detect objects
The list of objects will then be spoken by a speech synthesis library
The eyes will track the objects or faces on screen and move the eyes to a position based on where the object is on screen

when python is detecting objects the eyes can 'think' by moving up and looking about
eye movement will be on a separate thread
